"""The tool contracts, in a fixed order.

The names are the architecture document's "Tool boundary" section, verbatim, and are
the contract: `tests/test_runtime_contracts.py` pins them, so renaming one is a
deliberate act with a version bump beside it. The list depends only on the deployment
config, never on the request, because it is part of the cached prefix (ADR 0028);
whether a capability can serve a particular call is decided in the executor and the
gates, not by adding or removing a tool.

Two boundary rules are expressed in the schemas themselves rather than in prose the
model may reinterpret:

* `add_to_cart` takes an `item_ref`, never a raw catalogue id. A reference is issued
  by the server when it renders a presentation, so "add the best one" resolves to
  something the customer was actually shown (ADR 0020).
* `stage_checkout` takes no cart. It reads the authenticated customer's authoritative
  cart server-side, so neither the model nor the transcript can substitute one
  (ADR 0021).
