"""The `MerchantPort` adapter over the normalized commerce core.

This is what retires the Phase 5 carry-over: the merchant surfaces read
`catalog_products`, `catalog_variants`, `variant_prices`, `inventory_levels` and
`commerce_events` — the same tables shopping reads — instead of the flat
`products` table shopping stopped touching. One catalogue, so a price the
operator sees is the price a shopper is charged, and a stock figure on the
alerts card is the figure that refuses a checkout.

Every read returns figures with their formula and operands attached, because the
acceptance criterion for this phase is lineage, not plausibility. Metrics come
from `MetricsRepository`, which recomputes from the event log rather than
carrying a running total (ADR 0018); estimates come from
`merchant_estimates`, which does arithmetic over those observed inputs and
nothing else (ADR 0017).

Reads are scoped to `seeded` origin by default. The store's trading history is
the seeded ninety days; a live demo purchase is `live_app` and is deliberately
not folded into it, and every payload names the origins it covered so the
distinction is visible rather than assumed (ADR 0032).
