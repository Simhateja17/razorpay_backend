"""One handler per merchant boundary tool, over `commerce_common`'s executor frame.

The shape mirrors the shopping executor, and so does the guarantee: `execute`
never raises, and every path out of a tool is one of the five typed outcomes, so
a bound that refuses a proposal reaches the model as something it can work with
and reaches the ledger as something a judge can read.

What is different is the ceiling. Every write handler here ends at
`MerchantPort.stage_change`, which produces a `pending` row and nothing else. The
executor asserts that before it returns: a staging that came back in any other
status is treated as a failure rather than reported as success, because the one
thing this surface must never do is tell an operator a change is live when the
host has not applied it (ADR 0016).

Each staging also carries its own evidence forward. The `before` document is not
the model's idea of the current value — it is read from the port at staging time,
so the proposal the operator approves states what the record actually said when
it was written, and the host can tell at application time whether that is still
true.
