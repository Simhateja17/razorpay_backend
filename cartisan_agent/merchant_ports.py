"""The merchant runtime's one integration surface.

Every method acts for the operator in `session`, whose identity came from a
verified Supabase `merchant_operator` principal (ADR 0010). The shape of this
port is the whole of ADR 0016 expressed in types: there are reads, there is
`stage_change`, and there is nothing else. No method approves, applies,
refunds, sends a campaign, or writes a price — those verbs do not exist here to
be called, so no future executor bug can reach one.

Keeping it a port is what lets the transcript evaluations drive the real turn
loop, the real gates and the real change ledger against a scripted model.
