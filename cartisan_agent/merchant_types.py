"""The merchant runtime's domain models.

Two things separate these from the shopping types. The principal is an operator,
not a customer, and every number carries the kind of claim it is (ADR 0017): a
figure the event log measured is `observed`, a figure a deterministic formula
produced from observed inputs is `estimated`, and `causal` is reserved for an
accepted experiment. Nothing in Cartisan produces the last one, so nothing in
this module can construct one — the enum exists so a model's attempt to make a
causal claim has a name to be refused under.

Money is integer minor units (paise), as everywhere else; the rupee label rides
alongside so the model quotes it rather than doing the arithmetic.
