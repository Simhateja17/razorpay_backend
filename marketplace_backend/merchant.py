"""The host's merchant surface.

This is the other half of ADR 0016. The agent's reach ends at a `pending` row in
`merchant_changes`; everything past that point lives here, behind an
authenticated `merchant_operator` principal, and none of it is callable by a
model. `MerchantService` has no tool contract, appears in no tool list, and is
reached only from the REST endpoints the portal's approval queue calls.

Approval and application are two steps for the same reason staging and
confirming are on the shopping side: they have different authorities and
different failure modes. The operator's decision is recorded first and stands on
its own — a rejection is a complete, evidenced outcome. Application then
re-reads the record, refuses a proposal whose target has moved
(`StaleProposal`) or whose bounds no longer hold (`PolicyViolation`), and only
then writes.

The writes go to the normalized commerce core — `variant_prices`,
`inventory_levels` and `inventory_movements`, `catalog_products`, `promotions`,
`campaigns` — which is what retires the flat `products` table the merchant
surfaces used to read. One catalogue: an approved price change moves the price a
shopper is charged and the price the agent quotes, because they are the same row.
