"""Staged merchant changes and host-controlled approval.

The split that matters: `stage` is the only verb the merchant agent can reach,
and it can only ever produce a `pending` row. `approve`/`reject` require an
authenticated operator, and `apply` re-validates policy against *current* state
before touching anything (ADR 0016). There is no method here that stages and
applies in one step, so no model-accessible path can apply a change.

Revalidation is deliberately against the world as it is at application time, not
against the documents the proposal stored. Two different things can go wrong
between staging and approval, and they are reported separately because they need
different answers:

* **Drift.** The `before` document no longer describes the record. The proposal
  was written about a price or a stock level that has since moved, so approving
  it would apply a diff to a different starting point. That is `StaleProposal`.
* **Bounds.** The proposal still describes the record, but measured against the
  record's *current* values the change is now outside policy — a 10% cut becomes
  a 40% cut when the list price drops underneath it. That is `PolicyViolation`.

Both leave the change `failed` with the reason in the evidence ledger, and
neither applies anything.
