"""The Razorpay handoff and the verified return path.

Two halves, deliberately separate:

  `PaymentLinkDispatcher`  drains `razorpay.payment_link.create` outbox messages,
                           calls the provider through the replaceable interface
                           (ADR 0011), and attaches the link to the attempt. The
                           host runs it; no model-reachable path enters here.

  `WebhookProcessor`       takes a signed provider callback, stores it once in the
                           deduplicating inbox, and applies it only when the exact
                           order, amount, currency and provider reference agree.
                           Everything else is quarantined with a reason.

The asymmetry between them is the point of ADR 0013. Creating a link is a request;
only a verified provider outcome is evidence. A browser redirect proves that a
person came back, so it can reach `payment_verification_pending` and no further.
