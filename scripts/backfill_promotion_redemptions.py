"""Link existing discounts to the promotion that explains them. Idempotent.

    python scripts/backfill_promotion_redemptions.py --dry-run
    python scripts/backfill_promotion_redemptions.py

Campaign attribution needs an order to name the promotion it redeemed. Seeded history
predates that column: it applied a flat ₹200 off any basket over ₹2,000 without ever
recording a promotion, so the discount was a number nothing could attribute.

The rule the generator was already applying *is* a promotion, it was simply never
written down as one. So this names it — MONSOON10 becomes "₹200 off orders above
₹2,000", which is exactly what those orders received — and points every discounted
order and stage at it. No amount changes: not a discount, not a total, not a paid
amount. The rows are only being explained, never rewritten.

AUDIO500 and SMARTHOME15 gain the category scope their descriptions always claimed.
Neither was ever redeemed in the existing history, so both honestly report zero
attributed orders until a fresh seed run applies them.

Run `python scripts/seed_commerce.py --validate` afterwards: `promotion redemptions`
proves every link the backfill made.
