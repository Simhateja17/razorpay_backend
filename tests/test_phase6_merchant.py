"""Phase 6 acceptance: the merchant agent, staged changes, and evidence lineage.

Two claims are on trial here, and a happy path proves neither.

**No model-accessible path applies a change.** Not "the agent is instructed not
to" and not "the tool list happens to omit it": the surface has no such tool, the
executor refuses one by name if a call arrives by any route, staging can only
produce `pending`, and the state machine has no edge from `pending` to `applied`.
Each of those is asserted separately, because each is a different way the
guarantee could be lost.

**Every approval or refusal has exact evidence lineage.** A rejection carries the
documents it rejected. An application that is refused says which check refused it
and what the record said at the time. A number the agent states can be recomputed
from the inputs it carried. The four cases that actually test this are a
rejection, a bounds failure at application time rather than staging time, a
proposal whose record moved underneath it, and a formula whose operands are
checkable — so those are the four that are written out.

Agent behaviour is proven against a scripted model, the pattern
`tests/test_runtime_transcripts.py` established: a gate is worth having precisely
because it holds when the model is wrong, so the evaluation has to be able to
make the model wrong on demand.
