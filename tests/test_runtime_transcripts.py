"""Phase 4 acceptance, part two: transcript evaluations.

Each test replays a fixed sequence of model responses through the real turn loop, the
real gates, the real commerce port, and the real turn persistence, and asserts on what
the runtime did with them: which tools ran, what was refused and why, what reached the
database, and what the request to the model actually looked like.

The model is scripted on purpose. A live model would make these slow and
non-deterministic, and — the point — would prove nothing about the gates: a gate is
worth having precisely because it holds when the model is wrong, so the evaluation has
to be able to make the model wrong on demand. `commerce_common.testing.FakeClient`
plays back one final message per `messages.stream` call and raises once the script runs
out, so a loop that keeps going fails the test rather than hanging it.
